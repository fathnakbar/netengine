# Netengine

Netengine is a backend generator project that helps developers quickly and easily create the backend for their web and mobile applications.

Using Netengine, developers can quickly generate a fully-functional backend that is customized to their specific needs and requirements. Netengine offers a variety of features and tools, including:

- Data modeling: Netengine provides a simple, intuitive interface for designing and modeling data structures and relationships.
- User authentication and authorization: Netengine provides tools for managing user accounts, authentication, and authorization.
- Push notifications: Netengine enables developers to send push notifications to their users through various channels.
- Real-time communication: Netengine provides real-time communication capabilities for building collaborative and interactive applications.
- API generation: Netengine automatically generates a RESTful API based on the data model, allowing developers to easily access and manipulate their data from the frontend.
- Deployment: Netengine offers seamless deployment to a variety of cloud platforms, making it easy to scale and manage the backend of the application.
- SDK (Software Development Kit): A collection of tools and libraries that developers can use to create software for a specific platform or language.
- Static Template: A template that is pre-defined and does not change at runtime. It is often used for simple websites or landing pages.
- Custom Admin Page: A web-based interface for managing and administering the backend of a web application. It is often used to perform tasks such as managing users, viewing logs, and updating settings.
- Data Analytics Tool: A tool that helps users to analyze, visualize, and gain insights from their data. It can be used for tasks such as reporting, forecasting, and identifying patterns.
- Documentation Generator: A tool that automatically generates documentation for a software project based on the code and comments within it.
- Scalability: The ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of load by adding more resources, such as servers or processors.
- Microservice: An architectural style where a large system is composed of small, independently deployable services that communicate with each other through APIs. Microservices are designed to be loosely coupled, meaning that they can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of one another.
- Auto-generated Unit Testing: A feature that automatically generates test cases for individual units of code, such as functions or methods. This can help to ensure that the code is working as expected and catch any regressions early on.
- Docker Container Support: A feature that allows the backend generator program to produce code that can be packaged and run inside a Docker container. It may include functionality such as configuring and creating the necessary Dockerfiles, and setting up the environment variables and ports required for the application to run.
- Kubernetes Support: A feature that allows the backend generator program to produce code that can be deployed and managed using Kubernetes. It may include functionality such as creating the necessary Kubernetes manifests, setting up services and deployment, configuring autoscaling, and providing an interface for managing the application on a Kubernetes cluster.
- API Integration: A feature that allows the backend generator program to integrate with third-party APIs. This can enable the application to access and use the functionality provided by these APIs, such as data storage, authentication, and payment processing. The integration may include functionality such as generating the necessary API calls and handling the API responses, as well as providing a user interface for configuring and managing the API connections. Additionally, it could also include security measures like handling access tokens, refreshing tokens and rate limiting.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, Netengine makes it easy to create a professional-grade backend for your application. Simply select your desired features and customizations, and Netengine will generate the backend for you.
